Automatic CRUD

Build CRUDs Automatically

**What is a CRUD?**

CRUD is the acronym for "Create", "Read", "Update" and "Delete", which is used to refer to the basic functions in databases or the layer persistence in software.

**Why Auto-CRUDx?**

The development of CRUDs is a repetitive task that is done regularly in the software development process. Once a standard structure is defined, for typical CRUDs, a tool that automatically generates them is useful.

**What is Auto-CRUDx?**

Auto-CRUDx is a tool that helps you create your own Automatic CRUD Generator, based on your own development stack and particular architecture.
